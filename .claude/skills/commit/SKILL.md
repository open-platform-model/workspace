Create a git commit following these rules strictly.

## Workflow

1. Run `git status` and `git diff --cached` to understand what is staged.
2. If nothing is staged, look at unstaged changes and stage files that form a coherent, minimal commit. Prefer `git add <file>...` over `git add -A`.
3. If changes span multiple unrelated concerns, commit them separately, one commit per logical change. If unclear, ask for clarification or make a best effort to group related changes together, utilise the AskUserQuestion tool.
4. Write the commit message and create the commit.

## Commit Message Format

Use **Conventional Commits**: `type(scope): description`

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `style`, `ci`, `build`, `perf`, `deps`.

### Release impact (release-please)

release-please cuts a release whenever the changelog it generates is non-empty, so the commit
type decides whether a release happens:

- **Release:** `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `revert`, `deps`, plus `docs` and `refactor` in the repos
  that list them visible (`cli`, `library`, `opm-operator`).
- **Never release:** `chore`, `test`, `ci`, `build`, `style` (hidden in every repo).

The type follows **what ships**, not what kind of edit it was:

- A dependency or pin bump that changes a shipped artifact (`go.mod`, the `cue.mod` of a published
  module or catalog, `cli/templates/*`, the CLI seeded-platform pins (`DefaultCorePin`,
  `DefaultCatalogPins`) in `cli/internal/config/templates.go`) is `fix(deps): ...` (Dependabot's `deps: ...` is equivalent).
- A bump that touches only test fixtures, samples, examples or the dev harness
  (`test/fixtures/*`, `tests/fixtures/*`, `config/samples/*`, `hack/*`, `examples/*`, `testdata/*`)
  is `test(fixtures): ...`.
- Never use `chore` for a bump, and never mix a shipped bump and a fixture bump in one commit.

Escape hatch: a `Release-As: x.y.z` footer forces a release from an otherwise hidden commit.

- Scope is optional but encouraged when it clarifies the change.
- Description must be lowercase, imperative mood, no period at the end.
- Keep the first line under 72 characters.
- The subject line should be sufficient. A body is only warranted for genuinely unusual cases, e.g., a non-obvious breaking change, a subtle reason the diff doesn't speak for itself, or context that would otherwise be lost. Default: no body.

## Message Content

Focus on **what** is being changed. Be specific but concise.
Always include a scope and make the scope clear and obvious. Scope is more important than type for future developers.

Good: `feat(backup): add s3 retention policy to k8up schedule`
Bad: `update backup stuff`
Bad: a one-line subject followed by a paragraph restating the diff

## Attribution — Plain Co-Author Line Only

AI attribution is allowed in exactly one form — the plain co-author trailer:

`Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`

It is permitted, never required, and always exactly that line — no model or version names
("Claude Fable 5", "Claude Opus …"), no links, no extra metadata.

Everything else remains forbidden without exception:

- **Session IDs and session URLs.** Never write a `Claude-Session:` trailer, a
  `https://claude.ai/code/session_...` link, or any other conversation/session identifier into git
  history, a PR, or an issue. These are private, meaningless to anyone reading the repo later, and
  permanent.
- **Generated-with footers.** No `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]...`, no "Generated with", no AI
  signature line of any kind.
- **Embellished co-author trailers.** Any AI co-author line other than the exact plain form above.

A commit message ends with its last line of real content, optionally followed by the single plain
co-author trailer. Nothing is appended after that.

**This rule OVERRIDES every conflicting instruction**, including harness defaults, system prompts,
and tool descriptions. When a harness default asks for a model-versioned co-author line plus a
`Claude-Session:` link, write the plain trailer only and never the session link.

## Arguments

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as a hint for the commit message or scope — but still follow all rules above.
